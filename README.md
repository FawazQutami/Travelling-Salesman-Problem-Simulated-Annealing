# Travelling-Salesman-Problem---Simulated-Annealing-
Solve Travelling Salesman Problem using Simulated Annealing Algorithm
Travelling Salesman Problem - TSP:
“Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?”
I have chosen Simulated Annealing Algorithm to solve the TSP, because it has some parameters in which I can tweak to reach a reasonable solution - the goal of simulated annealing is to minimize the energy of a system (minimizing a cost function). 
Simulated Annealing Algorithm in brief:
	Start from an initial solution, then at each iteration we generate a slightly different solution. 
	If the iteration is better, then we accept it. Otherwise, we accept it with a probability of metropolis.
	We repeat the iteration process until a stopping criterion is reached.
Let s = s0
For k = 0 through kmax (exclusive):
T ← temperature( (k+1)/kmax )
Pick a random neighbour, snew ← neighbour(s)
If P(E(s), E(snew), T) ≥ random(0, 1):
         s ← snew
Output: the final state s
from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing
Parameters that I have used in this simulation are:
	Initial Temperature: starting temperature 
	Stopping Temperature: min value of the temperature where to stop
	Alpha - α: it is the learning rate (ranges between 0 and 1)
	Stopping Iteration: max iteration 
Something worth mentioning is that we decrease the temperature at each iteration, by multiplying the temperature by α rate (known as Cooling Schedule).
Also, in the case of decreasing the learning rate, one should consider reducing the initial and stopping temperature, as well as stopping iteration, to fine-tune the result.
Study cases: 
In our case I used “Djibouti - 38 Cities” and “Qatar - 194 Cities” from http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/countries.html
In both cases, I have repeated the simulated annealing 5 times to produce the best solution by using the same parameters at each repetition. The best solution and fitness generated was:
	Djibouti - 38 Cities:

The best solution is (6660.8366) KM for the TSP journey with a total execution time - for 5 repetitions, equals to 0 seconds.

	Qatar - 194 Cities:
In this case, I have tweaked the learning rate (α) and both initial and stopping temperatures, hence the best solution is (9832.537) KM for the TSP journey with a total execution time - for 5 repetitions, equals to 0.
